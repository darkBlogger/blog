## New year's eve is a good time for some resolutions.

New year's eve is a good time. Right? After all this pandemic thing, We should do something new like hobbies or some new app or some ideas. Think and do something and nice or fix open source issues.

I will update my list in a week or so. You will find it here soon.

Things to do.
 - Complete [Forest](https://github.com/darkRaspberry/Forest). It's a awesome game which works in node in Firebase.
 - Complete all pending work in [GitHub's Projects](https://github.com/darkRaspberry?tab=projects).
 - Monetize enough to get all my domain registered and working.(I will try to keep all the things in ratio of cost vs speed)
