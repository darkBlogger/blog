## Are we slave of Tech?!

So HI!
Firstly Merry Christmas.

Lets talk about coding apps. What is a good tech/app. Like we all obsessed with social media. In other words we are slave of social media. 1% of you guys deny, But we know the truth. We are slave of some tech and like email, or anything. Which is not a bad thing right. When bicycle is invented we became salve of it instantly, Which has no issue, right. Then why now? -THIS IS THE REAL QUESTION!.

When we invented **Bicycle**, It helps us to travel places faster, Right! which is nice, Tech should always save time and effort. Now consider **social media**, Some people says its the same, Isn't it? NO! The whole social media is controlled by super-computers which are governed by a handful of people. This is very very bad. Lets deep inside, Super-computer predict the state of mind of the user, thus providing the best recommendations in never ending library, Thus increasing the screen time. Got! 

Let's back to the bicycle, It saves time. But social media is consume time. Which is not serious. Let's little deep. How do they recommends the next? They collect data. Like tons of data, And they process it to get the extreme and get the exact prediction of recommended. Which is not nice.

The conclusion is "AI is changing this world". AI control the minute change in the world. They can change the behavior very minute very slowly. So normal people don't understand AI is controlling them. AI is just a bunch of very powerful supercomputer with very perfect prediction what you like or what you not, with null intelligence(what is fake or what is incorrect.)
