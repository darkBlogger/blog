 "SO hello guys this is first blog ......"

 I don't do any shit like this ☝️ . I'm not wasting anyone time lets be crystal clear.

 Here this is first blog mark the date and time

I'll do many `past editing`. Many of you are not families with this, actually all of you are not aware with this term.

Lets define this.

# What is past editing?

Its a technical term of editing a doc/text or any file in past.(Noone got it right!)

When a digital file is edited, it save the current time of the system in which it was edited. Now if anyone edit a file in a system which have date and time lags so the file saved will have a past date and time, it is called as past editing.

There is a catch. let's discuss.
its consists of 2 terms `past` and `editing`.

 - `past`-it tells about old time/something happened earlier.
 - `editing`-continuous tense. 

 Many of you are wondering why the hell I'm telling this.
 If you want to read this blog please keep this in mind.

  - I will do past editing.
  - New rule will be added....
