## Linux, You heard of it. Right!
For those who don't know. Linux is a free OS and also open-sourced. It will work on anything you can imagine. Like from self driving cars to super computer, From your smartphone to airplane everything works on Linux. The whole linux is controlled by some psycho penguins or penguin lovers.

## What's the problem, then?
Linux is very powerful and most vastly used OS in the world. But wait you will say, *"Hey boomer, It's Windows"* and you are technically right. But I said most vastly used. So, I'm right.

Linux is everywhere. But you can't see it. Your whole internet is run by Linux. Let's stop this glory story and jump to main point. What's wrong with linux. Why we can't see any linux generally, If Linux is so powerful?

## Answers

The answer is not a straight forward things. And I don't want this to be a 50000 words easy. So lets focus on main things.

#### Apps for linux

Linux has way less apps than Windows, And If sometimes you search just apps, developers of distributors thinks you need a `.exe` file. AHHH!!! ðŸ˜ . If you ask why there is less apps on Linux. It's because, there are less people who use linux. It's the same egg chicken thing. If there are more people who use linux then there will be more apps.

#### Linux apps compatibility.

If you ask what is this, I got you covered. If you and your friend wanna talk, but you both speak different language. You can't chit-chat right. Same with apps, If a app is designed for windows then it will not work on Linux. It so simple because it's different OS, What about compatibility across Linux.

There are 600 different distro, basically means 600 types of Linux and apps made for one will not run on another. Why is there 600 distro? (we will discuss latter.)

There is `.deb` and `.rpm` and they don't works with each others. Moreover same distro apps doesn't works with older release of same distro. To simplify this, If a debian app works with current version it will not necessarily works with previous ones. Pretty f/*ked up here. 

#### OEMs

Yes, I have a problem with OEMs also. OEMs are original equipment manufactures. They doesn't contribute, which is fine but they do make life hard for the linux users. You will ask *"What did they do this time."* What is the least you expect from a OEM? ***Firmware***, This is the least I expect, And they make hell in these also. OEMs make firmware only be installed on Windows. WHY!! ðŸ¤¬ . I don't want to install Windows only to update *Firmware*.

There are few more but I don't want that here now. May be in future.

## What you can do!

You can ask people to switch, as more people use it. Many basic problem will be solved. People who use Windows might wanna kill you if you asked any Windows lover to switch from it.

BYE ðŸ‘‹ Keep using Linux.
