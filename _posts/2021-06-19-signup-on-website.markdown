## The ease of SignUp

Let's talk about the first thing you do when you open the website. You will get notification to create a account on that shitty website. Right! Nothing unusual its basic. I smell no fish here! Now if you follow *west* then you will go ahead and share your personal information by creating a accounts.

## Realization - Privacy is a thing.

But when finally your brain cells become active and suddenly came to know what privacy(A bird with bright feathers.) is! Then you think of deleting your account.

Now If you remember the ease of creating your account, It's so smoooooth. Few clicks here and few clicks there voila there is your new and exclusive account. Now when you make mind to tame that bird(Privacy - A bird with bright feathers), And try to kill that account just because you want to delete your *What your pet eat on sunday* OR *What color of underwear you like.*(personal data) or just lose trust in that specific service you created account for.

## Reality of Accounts.
There is no direct options for deleting your account. In most of the cases there is actually NO any options to delete that account. But you will say- "Hey dark, Did you check their *Privacy Policy* they must said something about this." I'll say, Hell yeh." You may find things like 
> If you want to delete your account you need to send us a mail at joking@shitty.company

Seems promising Right!. WELL NOOO, When you send mail "I wanna delete my account" They'll not respond on bad days, They might even deny the fact of receiving any mails from you. Deleting account is soooooo complicated.

## Why they do this?

Let's count from basic.
  - The developer is too lazy to make that **Delete My Account** button active. Because he can literally count on his fingers how many people need that button or use that button in his whole fecking life.
  - Why bother? If this doesn't affect them. Imagine there is gangwar totally unrelated to you. Will you take part in that occasional fest? NO. They don't care if you delete your account or not. If you are about to delete your account. This will never increase their revenue, Then why the hell they bother.
  You never asked for? Remember the mail asking you to fill feedback. Did you ever said you need it?

## Solution and Conclusion

Don't create account on any websites. It's ok to go without account. If creating account is necessary make sure they provide a delete account button straight in face. Else use a temp mail to create accounts.

This is not a problem of big tech giants they do provide you a delete account option for sure. But I'm not sure for smaller companies. Skip using them which don't provide a working privacy policy. READ IT! Yes. Read [Privacy Policy](/privacyPolicy/) here is ours. And keep your eye open.
