A clear answer is a yes!. But real question is "How much?"

Here we try to evaluate about the hype, When a tech giant head says- 

> Use Signal

Things became little hard for Facebook.

First things first! There are broadly 2 things:

 - When we normally chat with WhatsApp user.
 - When we chat with a business account. 

When we chats with normal WhatsApp user(s) our chats are *end-to-end encrypted*. Which doesn't have any issue. So! This is minute thing that we need to see this. There is a small thing called *Personal data*. Many of you heard this bird named - *Personal data*, Right! For those who don't know. 

**Quick Revise -** Personal data are those data which can identify you, Example-Your Phone number, IMEI, etc

So earlier WhatsApp use these personal data, for their so called R&D and analytics to improve WhatsApp. Now your personal data from WhatsApp is used to improve Facebook too! That's the main thing. So what's the issue with it? Google does this whole time, they just use our personal data to improve all the products across Google. 

This is a complex thing to understand, When we installed WhatsApp we accept to share data with WhatsApp, But then Facebook bought it. We have no issue till WhatsApp and Facebook didn't interrupted each other. But now they are forcing us to share data of WhatsApp with Facebook which we didn't signed up for, this is hurting us, Maybe!.

Now we move-on to a 2nd point. What happen when we chat with business? When we chat with business our data is shared with Facebook, And the business with which we are contacting. Thats end? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! That data we shared with business user will be now governed by the new privacy policy deployed by business. And so ur juicy private data will now move next to 3rd party. Then to 4th party and show on! At a point you may think is this data belong to you!

End of story! **Fuck your Privacy!** by big tech Inc.

In next post of privacy we will take a look about a statement you usually heard - 
> I'm no Elon Musk. My data/Personal data is not precious!
We will kill this statement forever.
