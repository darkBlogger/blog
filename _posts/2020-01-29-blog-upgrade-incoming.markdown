HI again.

As you can see there is no any update in recent week. so!? Actually I'm having a hard time maintaining the blog. I tired to update the Front-end and add a CMS to it for easy management. But that require too time+skill. I will try to update it for that conditions.

There are few more reason:
 - As blogs are hard to monetize.
 - No notifications for new updates.

All this issue will be solved with Youtube. SO I created a Youtube and will try to explain things there. Its will be more interesting guess.
