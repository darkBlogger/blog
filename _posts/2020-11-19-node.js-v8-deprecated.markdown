The thing I want to write in this post is this chunk of text.

>  - Node.js 8 (deprecated as of June 8, 2020) Deployment of Node.js 8 functions will no longer be allowed after February 15, 2021. Then, executions of already-deployed Node.js 8 functions will stop after March 15, 2021. If you have deployed functions to the Node.js 8 runtime, you're recommended to upgrade to the Node.js 10 runtime.

The think is I'm not a big dev so I'm working hard to make my app forest work. But the Firebase dev wanna to stop the spark pack and kill the life-line. This is very bad thing. In recent year google has killed many projects in the last year. Like in 2021 they are killing the unlimited storage of Google Photos. I don't wanna say anything about google they are big people but seriously. Please don't don't kill us. ~~I don't wanna include a donation button on this page.~~ 

I just wanna say to google please don't do this. You guys are killing the small Devs who can't pay.
