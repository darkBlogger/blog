## How good is to be a seeder in torrent?

Like we all love torrent because it gives us the peek speed that we can get in our bandwidth without any server. Plus its decentralize. So what do you think? huh?

Ok lets just be practical. There are tons of people who pay the bandwidth they use and on other hand there are people who pay for the amount of data they transfer. Like one of my friend always seems to cry with that their JIO daily limit expired. Hahah! pretty insane. Other friend only pay for bandwidth of channel they are using. They can use the theoretical unlimited data. We can broadly divide people in these 2 categories.

So some people can easily say yup, You got all the exact fact and that seems like justified. The people who have bandwidth they just seed. Else if you got charged by data then be cool and just cut the fibre-cable when torrent finished.

There is a thing which you have to take care. Torrent is Purely P2P, it just required a additional tracker who take care of all the seeder and leechers and connect them.

The conclusion is there is not hard & fast rule. But there should be ethics of the leechers, they should atlest upload 0.5 if they can.
