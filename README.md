## About this project
This is a repo to store and host my [blog](https://blog.darkrasp.ga).

### Tech used
I used many things to host and make this.
- It uses a jekyll theme, Which means it is Ruby based which is kinda a pain for me to maintain. And I don't want it.
- It is hosted in Cloudflare edge server to reach you at the very fast.

*And probably it's not gonna update because I can't maintain a extra repo or stack.*
