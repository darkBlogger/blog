 If you are reading this it's your choice.

*This is pseudo static blog.*

## What does it mean?
In dumb language, This blog don't collect your personal data in anyway. We don't serve different content to different people.

## What do we talk here?
We talk tech in general. But we are not limited to it.

Anything which consists atleast a drop amount of code will be listed here. We talk about good apps which increase productivity and other apps which make your like hard like bloats on your device. We rant on big companies which they don't care. All they care is sweet sweet moneyðŸ’°. So rant over them. We talk about privacy and everything which bothers a developer-cum-user.

We uses open-source apps and recommends the same. Not because most of them are free, But we can simply look inside a apps and may be build some other apps on the top of that. And anything which ease life of a user.

## What is the ultimate goal.

I know this doesn't effect anyone but I can't change your mind. But I can actively show you the difference what a good app can do. We try to solve or simplify, How a app should work? How AI should grow? What are the boundaries of AI or Will they rule the world? How social network effects us? How data collection is ethical by AI or big companies with or without concent.
